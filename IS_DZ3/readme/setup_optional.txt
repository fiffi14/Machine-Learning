python3 -m pip install
py --version
py -m pip --version


Open Project Settings:
Navigate to File > Settings (or PyCharm > Preferences on macOS).
Expand Project: <Your Project Name> in the left-hand panel.
Select Python Interpreter.


Add a New Interpreter:
Click the gear icon next to the "Python Interpreter" dropdown.
Select Add....


Choose Environment Type:
In the "Add Python Interpreter" dialog, select Virtualenv Environment from the left-hand menu.


Configure New Virtual Environment:
Choose New environment.
Specify the Location for the virtual environment (typically within your project directory, e.g., venv).
Select the Base interpreter (the Python version installed on your system that the virtual environment will be based on).
Optionally, check "Inherit global site-packages" if you want the virtual environment to access packages installed globally.
Optionally, check "Make available to all projects" if you intend to reuse this specific virtual environment across multiple projects.


Create and Select:
Click OK to create the virtual environment. PyCharm will create the venv folder and install basic packages like pip and setuptools.
Ensure the newly created virtual environment is selected as the Project Interpreter in the "Python Interpreter" settings.


Install Dependencies:
If you have a requirements.txt file, PyCharm will usually prompt you to install the listed packages.
Alternatively, you can manually install packages by clicking the + button in the "Python Interpreter" settings and searching for the desired packages.


Note: If you are connecting to an existing virtual environment, you would select "Existing environment" in step 4 and provide the path to the Python executable within that environment.
