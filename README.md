ML supervised algorithms - Classification Decision Tree and Linear Regression with gradient descent

- Not much on how to run project, just run files separately.
- Cakes2.py resolve the classification problem of predicting if the given recipe is for a cupcake or a muffin based on the mass percentages and using entropy for classification. Corresponding .csv file is cakes_train.csv
- Prices.py predicts prices for a house using linear regression. Two solutions are given - self-implemented model and built-in one with the same score. Paremeters used for the model and for the gradient descent can be found in the code after plotting and feature engineering.
